Bug Collecting App

Problem Statement: Insect Collecting is a multi-step process. You find an insect and record collecting information. 
After that you transfer that data to a label, generally using a template. Eventually you may upload to some database. 
The primary goal is to streamline some of that process, while adding other useful features.
