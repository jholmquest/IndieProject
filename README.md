Bug Collecting App

Bug collecting is a popular hobby around the world. People of all ages do it, and some even make a career out of it.
One of the challenges associate with collecting bugs is keeping track of every last one.
BugNet is an application designed to store information on insects collected, for access anywhere.
In it's current form it is very basic, designed for a casual user. Over time the plan is to add more features to make it useful for all levels.
