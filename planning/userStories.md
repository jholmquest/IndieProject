# User 1
 The Professional User

Students as well, wants information organized into as many fields as possible. Latitude and Longitude important for location.
ITIS is a site with taxonomic data that I could integrate when the user could enter the
scientific name of an insect, and it could retrieve the rest of the information.


# User 2
The Hobby User

Enjoys collecting bugs in their spare time, but does not require as detailed information.
Give them option for less strict categories, mainly text fields that can be filled out as desired.
Don't overwhelm with specific fields, leaving empty fields feels bad so better to not show them.
Having this up and working would be the absolute minimum.
