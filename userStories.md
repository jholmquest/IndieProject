Students as well, wants information organized into as many fields as possible. Latitude and Longitude important for location.
Eventually want to add support for a full taxonomic identification, but that is a little more complex than the scope of this project.

Enjoys collecting bugs in their spare time, but does not require as detailed information.
Give them option for less strict categories, mainly text fields that can be filled out as desired.
Don't overwhelm with specific fields, leaving empty fields feels bad so better to not show them.
